BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn.  

BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard annotations), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboards, shared notes, and breakout rooms.  During the session, BigBlueButton generates analytics that are visible to moderators in the Learning Analytics Dashboard.

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed BigBlueButton for online learning, it can be used for many other applications as well.  The educational use cases for BigBlueButton are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)

The latest version is BigBlueButton 2.7.  You can install BigBlueButton 2.6 on Ubuntu 20.04 using [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) within 30 minutes (or your money back 😉).
